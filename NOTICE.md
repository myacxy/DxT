- If your project is open source include this license file in the source.
- Nothing is needed in the front facing project (UNLESS you
  are using any of the icons listed below in the attribution section).
- Commercial use is not only allowed but encouraged. If it is an icon
  in the attribution list below, you still need to attribute those!
- Do not distribute the entire package (I've allowed this dozens of
  times for open source projects, but email me first).

*** Icons I've copied so closely you want to attribute them and are also under the CC license.
