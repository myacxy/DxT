DashClock Twitch
================

* Customizable update interval
* Filter which channels you really want to display
* Customize the detailed information of a channel being presented
* Integration of a game database that helps you abbreviate game titles by predicting their proper names
* Create custom game title abbreviations in order to save space
* Limit the length of the information displayed inside the extension (DashClock does not use a monospaced font, though, and thus results may differ)
* UserVoice integration
